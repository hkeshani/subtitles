Gardens in the Islamic World, especially ones mentioned in stories, were often places filled with music and song. In the 13th century Arabic story Bayad and Riyad, a young man and woman cleverly flirt in public by singing passionate songs to one another. They are in a palace garden surrounded by people, but this does not stop them.

The story unfolds in the palatial residence of an official and his daughter in Andalusia, Spain, at a time when Muslim courts held sway. The official’s daughter is the lady of the household, and she feels very protective of her female servants and their honour.

As she is offered wine, she gazes over them, noticing that their eyes are fixed adoringly on a handsome young man from Damascus named Bayad. He is playing an oud, a Middle Eastern instrument similar to a lute or guitar.

Bayad has already fallen in love with one of the young women in the group at first glance. Her name is Riyad. A song about piercing eyes and desire has just finished, and Bayad has been invited to offer a song as well. It includes the lines, “Love holds absolute power over my soul, A power that would make the hardest iron melt.”

Courtyard palace gardens, like the one pictured here, were a popular feature in the palaces of Muslim and Christian rulers of medieval Spain. Often planted with orange and myrtle trees, they were both relaxing and romantic places to enjoy both company and song.
